            <h1>Divs Ids and Classes</h1>
            <h3><u>DIV</u></h3>

            <P>A div is an element with no style and no real purpose. It is used as an open container.</P>

            <div >Go</div>

            <div >Stop</div>

            <h3><u>IDS</u></h3>

            <p>An ID allows you to target a specific element and attach 
             CSS stylings to JUST THAT ELEMENT WITH THAT ID.
            In CSS ids are targeted using the # sign.IDS can be given
             to ANY ELEMENT not just divs</p>

            <div id ="go">GO</div>

            <div id ="stop">STOP</div>

            <p>A CLASS allows you to target a GROUP of elements, even if they are different elements. In CSS classes are targeted using the . sign.</p>

            <h1> This is some sample text.</h1>

            <p class ="bigtext">This some more sample text.</p>

            <div class ="bigtext">This is some more text.</div>

            <p>A paragraph I don't want to change.</p>
